# Project-C++
Departmental Management System

Complete Code Without Error...

Here you have all concepts of OOP
1. Inheritance
2. Encapsulation
3. Abstraction
4. Polymorphism

In this Code you have to describe your self (who you are at Departmental Store)
1. Customer
2. Admin
3. Dealer

--> As a costomer you have to purcahse itmes (40) items are availabe and then bill can be generated automatically including GST Tax
--> As an admin you have to change rule and add items delete items check stock dates expiry date etc
--> As a dealer you have to come and ask about the item to be purchased and then bill can be generated for that coming stock.

Thanks for your responce.
